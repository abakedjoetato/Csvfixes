TASK:
CSV files are being detected but none are being processed. Previous shallow fixes have been ineffective. Initiate a full-stack diagnostic and resolution process.

OBJECTIVE:
Identify and resolve all logical, syntactic, or systemic faults in the CSV parsing pipeline to achieve successful CSV processing and full compliance with all 11 rules defined in rules.md.

CONSTRAINTS:

No superficial or cosmetic fixes permitted.

Do not mark the issue resolved until the root cause is eliminated and processing is verifiably functional.

All 11 rules in rules.md must be interpreted, applied, and enforced.


PROCESS FLOW:

1. System-Wide Trace:

Perform deep trace of CSV parser module.

Inspect all interconnected modules, including I/O, decoding, schema inference, and data dispatch.

Identify and document any of the following:

Logic faults (e.g. incorrect branching, missing handlers).

Syntax errors (e.g. malformed statements, undeclared vars).

Type mismatches (e.g. expected list → received None).

Null reference accesses.

Faulty CSV structure assumptions.




2. Resource Utilization:

Use sample CSV files in attached assets for validation.

Simulate various file conditions: valid, invalid, empty, partially corrupted.



3. Rules Compliance:

Parse rules.md and enforce all 11 directives during all validation and execution processes.

Log rule violations with file path, rule ID, and offending code segment.



4. Knowledge Aggregation:

Query external knowledge bases for common causes of silent CSV ingestion failures:

5. Fix Implementation:

Apply verified fixes to codebase.

Re-test CSV parsing end-to-end using test files and rule compliance checks.



6. Output:

Summary report of issue cause, resolution steps, and validation results.

List of all code changes made with file names and line ranges.




END STATE:
CSV files must be ingested and processed as expected. System must comply with all rules.md conditions. Zero known bugs, misconfigurations, or unhandled cases should remain.
